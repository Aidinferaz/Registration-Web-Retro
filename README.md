# 🕹️ Retro Styled Member Registration Portal

Welcome to the **Member Registration Portal**—a fun, retro-inspired web application for user registration, designed with pixel-art aesthetics and classic arcade vibes!  
Built using **CSS** (43.8%), **JavaScript** (39.8%), and **HTML** (16.4%).

## 🎯 Project Overview

This portal lets users sign up as members via an online form, complete with robust input validation, instant feedback, and a visually nostalgic interface. All member data is stored locally in your browser using `localStorage`, making the app blazing fast and privacy-friendly—no server required!

## ✨ Features

- **Member Registration:** Users enter their full name, email, phone number, gender, birth date, and address.
- **Form Validation:** Real-time error messages ensure clean, correct data.
- **LocalStorage Integration:** All member data is saved and managed in your browser.
- **Dynamic Member List:** Instantly view registered members in cool grid-style cards, complete with all details.
- **Delete Options:** Remove individual members or clear all with one click—fully synced to local storage!
- **Responsive Design:** Looks great on desktops and mobile devices alike.

## 📝 How It Works

1. **Fill the Form:**  
   Enter required details. The form checks for errors (e.g., valid email, phone number format, required fields) before allowing submission.

2. **Register:**  
   Successful registration displays a confirmation and adds your data to the member list.

3. **View & Manage Members:**  
   The member list section displays all registered users. Use the `X` button to delete a single entry, or the "Hapus Semua Member" button to clear all.
